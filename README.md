# DevilDaggersCustomLeaderboards (DEPRECATED)

DevilDaggersCustomLeaderboards is a console application that records data from custom spawnset runs in Devil Daggers by scanning the memory of the application in real-time, and uploads it to a custom leaderboard hosted on [devildaggers.info](https://devildaggers.info).

## IMPORTANT

**This program is deprecated and will not receive new features.** You can use the [new tools](https://devildaggers.info/tools) instead. The source code for the new tools can be found in the [DevilDaggersInfo](https://github.com/NoahStolk/DevilDaggersInfo) repository.
